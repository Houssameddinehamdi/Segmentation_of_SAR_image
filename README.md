# Segmentation_of_SAR_image

Thanks to imaging capability day and night of SAR radars, SAR images have become useful in many fields despite the presence of Speckle noise that makes viewing such images difficult. In order to facilitate classification and allow easy object identification or even target detection, image processing and analysis is required.
The goal of this work is to segment a SAR radar image using the different approaches based on contours, regions and pixel classification or thresholding according to their intensity.
